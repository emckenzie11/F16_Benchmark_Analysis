F16 Benchmark Data Analysis

## About

The F16 Benchmark is a GVT on a F16 aircraft carrier. It's primary area of interest is surroudning the nonlinear connection between the wing and the payload. This analysis aims to identify the nonlinearities, quanitfying them where possible. Ultimately, we want to build a model that describes the system dynamics using the given training data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x 

## Installation

1. Create and activate a virtualenv:
   - python -m venv .venv
   - source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   - .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

2. Install dependencies:
   - pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Run the main scripts. Each script has a different function and can be combined to gather an overall understanding of the system.
